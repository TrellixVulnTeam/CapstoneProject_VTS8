## Starting the app

After you've cloned this repo onto your computer: 

To start the app, you'll need to cd into the serverSide folder in your IDE terminal, and enter *nodemon index.js*

You have to do this **FIRST** before you npm run start on your React App, so that the React App can open on the next available port. 

After you've started your server and verified it's listening on PORT 3000 (check the IDE terminal), you can open up the terminal on your computer and cd into the capstone project folder, where package.JSON lives, and enter
*npm run start*

It will ask you if you want to open on the next port available, enter **y**

It will then compile the site and open it in your preferred browser. 

## Styling

Brittney Rawlings did the styling on this site, and enjoyed discovering different animations to use with React. 

She chose a color scheme similar to GoFundMe:
